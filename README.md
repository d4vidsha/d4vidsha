### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**What do you mean by principled programmer?**

I want to follow the best practices for any particular problem, so that it makes development easier for anyone that picks up my code. I will abide by this policy through reading any necessary documentation to understand to a deeper level of anything that I write. It's trivial to use LLMs, but it's next level when it comes from the heart.
